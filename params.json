{"name":"Building a web application with Mojolicious and Ember-CLI.","tagline":"","body":"This is the first part of a multi-part tutorial which will help you get started developing web applications using [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org) and [Ember-CLI](http://ember-cli.com). Ember is a JavaScript framework for creating ambitious web applications. Ember-CLI also ships with a data-persistence library called ember-data, which can communicate with a back-end API. We can use Mojolicious, a web framework written in Perl, to serve the API for ember-data to consume. To understand why you would want to build a application with a this type of architecture, take a look at [Mixu's single page app book](http://singlepageappbook.com/goal.html).\r\n\r\n## Tooling\r\n\r\nFirst we will run through the tooling that you will need on your development machine. Each section has an explanation and the recommended commands to run. The recommended commands may contain version numbers which are out of date, so please check the relevant tool website to get the latest versions. It is assumed that you are using either Linux or OSX.\r\n\r\n### Perl 5\r\n\r\nLinux and OSX come with a system Perl 5 installation. However, since it's used for critical operating system tasks, it's best to leave that installation alone, and install Perl separately. I recommend the use of [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) to install and manage non-system Perl installations. Once you have installed Perlbrew, install the latest stable version of Perl 5. Stable versions have an even number as the minor release, for example, 5.22.1 is stable, 5.23.7 is not.\r\n\r\n#### Quick start\r\n\r\n    $ \\curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash\r\n\r\n    $ perlbrew install 5.22.1\r\n\r\n### cpanm\r\n\r\nFor installing modules from the CPAN, the tool of choice is [cpanm](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus). If you're using Perlbrew, you should use the built in cpanm installer.\r\n\r\n#### Quick start\r\n\r\n    $ perlbrew install-cpanm\r\n\r\n### Node.js\r\n\r\nEmber-CLI uses the JavaScript runtime [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and its accompanying package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to perform certain tasks like installing add-ons and starting up a development server. For Perl, we used Perlbrew to manage our Perl installations, and similarly here we will use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage our Node installations. Install nvm, followed by the latest stable version of Node.\r\n\r\n    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash\r\n\r\n    $ nvm install v5.5.0\r\n\r\n### MySQL\r\n\r\nFor this tutorial we will use the relational database [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) for our persistent storage. The installation instructions differ per operating system.\r\n\r\n    # On OSX with Homebrew installed...\r\n    $ brew install mysql\r\n\r\n    # On Ubuntu...\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
