{"name":"Building a web application with Mojolicious and Ember-CLI.","tagline":"","body":"This is the first part of a multi-part tutorial which will help you get started developing web applications using [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org) and [Ember-CLI](http://ember-cli.com). Ember is a JavaScript framework for creating ambitious web applications. Ember-CLI also ships with a data-persistence library called ember-data, which can communicate with a back-end API. We can use Mojolicious, a web framework written in Perl, to serve the API for ember-data to consume.\r\n\r\nTo understand why you would want to build a application with a this type of architecture, take a look at this page of [Mixu's single page app book](http://singlepageappbook.com/goal.html).\r\n\r\n## Tooling\r\n\r\nFirst we will run through the tooling that you will need on your development machine. Each section has an explanation and the recommended commands to run. The recommended commands may contain version numbers which are out of date, so please check the relevant tool website to get the latest versions. It is assumed that you are using either Linux or OS X.\r\n\r\n### Perl 5\r\n\r\nLinux and OS X come with a system Perl 5 installation. However, since it's used for critical operating system tasks, it's best to leave that installation alone, and install Perl separately. I recommend the use of [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) to install and manage non-system Perl installations. Once you have installed Perlbrew, install the latest stable version of Perl 5. Stable versions have an even number as the minor release, for example, 5.22.1 is stable, 5.23.7 is not.\r\n\r\n    # Install perlbrew...\r\n    $ \\curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash\r\n\r\n    # Install perl...\r\n    $ perlbrew install 5.22.1\r\n\r\n    # Use the newly-installed perl...\r\n    $ perlbrew use 5.22.1\r\n\r\n    # Verify it worked...\r\n    $ perl -v\r\n    This is perl 5, version 22, subversion 1 (v5.22.1)...\r\n\r\n### cpanm\r\n\r\nFor installing modules from the CPAN, the tool of choice is [cpanm](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus). If you're using Perlbrew, you should use the built in cpanm installer.\r\n\r\n    $ perlbrew install-cpanm\r\n\r\n### Node.js\r\n\r\nEmber-CLI uses the JavaScript runtime [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and its accompanying package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to perform certain tasks like installing add-ons and starting up a development server. For Perl, we used Perlbrew to manage our Perl installations, and similarly here we will use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage our Node installations. Install nvm, followed by the latest stable version of Node.\r\n\r\n    # Install nvm...\r\n    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash\r\n\r\n    # Install Node...\r\n    $ nvm install v5.5.0\r\n\r\n    # Did it work?...\r\n    $ node --version\r\n    v5.5.0\r\n\r\n### MySQL\r\n\r\nFor this tutorial we will use the relational database [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) for our persistent storage. The installation instructions differ per operating system.\r\n\r\n    # On OS X with Homebrew installed...\r\n    $ brew update && brew install mysql\r\n\r\n    # On Ubuntu...\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6\r\n\r\n    # Verify it worked...\r\n    $ mysql --version\r\n    mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.21\r\n\r\n### Ember-CLI\r\n\r\nNow let's install Ember-CLI itself, which can accomplish many tasks including installing dependencies, starting a development server, running tests, generating code and more.\r\n\r\n    $ npm install -g ember-cli\r\n\r\n    # Did it work?\r\n    $ ember --version\r\n    version: 1.13.15\r\n\r\nThe `-g` option instructs npm to install Ember-CLI globally (for the current Node version). This will allow us to run ember commands from the command line.\r\n\r\n### Mojolicious\r\n\r\nNext we'll install Mojolicious. Again, we want to install it globally (for the current Perl version).\r\n\r\n    $ cpanm Mojolicious\r\n\r\n    # Verify it worked...\r\n    $ mojo version\r\n    CORE\r\n      Perl        (v5.22.1, darwin)\r\n      Mojolicious (6.41, Clinking Beer Mugs)\r\n\r\n## Project Setup\r\n\r\nFor our application structure, let's aim to create something along the following lines:\r\n\r\n    music-app\r\n    |- ember\r\n    |- mojo\r\n\r\nCreate the base directory and cd into it. Note, `$_` is a special parameter in bash that holds the last parameter of the previous command.\r\n\r\n    ~/$ mkdir music-app && cd $_\r\n\r\nNow we will use the ember and mojo CLIs to generate their base application code. First, Ember:\r\n\r\n    # This will take a minute or so...\r\n    ~/music-app$ ember new music-app && mv $_ ember\r\n\r\nNext, Mojolicious:\r\n\r\n    ~/music-app$ mojo generate app MusicApp && mv music_app mojo\r\n\r\nTo confirm it worked, list the contents of the directory.\r\n\r\n    ~/music-app$ ls -p\r\n    ember/ mojo/\r\n\r\n## Start Your Engines\r\n\r\nWe haven't written any code at this point, but we should still be able to start the front-end and back-end development servers. Mojolicious ships with a development web server called [morbo](http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/morbo). At this point you may wish to start up a couple of terminals - one for each server.\r\n\r\n    # Start the back-end...\r\n    ~/music-app$ cd mojo && morbo script/music_app\r\n    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000\r\n\r\n    # In another terminal, start the front-end...\r\n    ~/music-app$ cd ember && ember serve --proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3000\r\n    version: 1.13.15\r\n    Proxying to http://127.0.0.1:3000\r\n    Livereload server on http://localhost:49152\r\n    Serving on http://localhost:4200/\r\n\r\nNote that when we started the front-end server, we proxied back-end requests to the address of the back-end server.\r\n\r\nTo confirm everything is working as expected, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser. You should see welcome screens for both endpoints which means your servers are running.\r\n\r\nWow, that was a lot, but we now have everything in place to start writing some actual code! Next time, we will do just that.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
